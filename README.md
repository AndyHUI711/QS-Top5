Executive Summary
Overview
In recent years, population aging and empty nester problem had become a hot topic globally, 78.1% of the elderly experienced moderate to severe loneliness in Anhui province. In China, the percentage of the elderly who prefer to receive home care increased around 5% from 2000 to 2010. Elderly people desire to be accompanied while they are less willing to bother their children. To best serve and understand elderly people, we utilized facial emotion plus audio recognition technology and AIoT (Artificial Internet of Things) to develope a system that can realize mutual care between family members.

Expected outcome
There are some problems in mental health for the elderly whose descendants do not live together. We will use IoT, big data, artificial intelligence technology to actively explore and promote "smart elderly care". Our vision and goals are as follows:
Care about empty nest elderly, and collect personal emotion data.
Provide a brand-new way for filial piety (xiao) promotion.
Prevent the elderly's potential mental health issues.
Maintain and strengthen family ties.
Establish a big data system and request follow-up studies.

Proposed solution
 In order to solve the problem and achieve our goals, the following has been done:  

Facial recognition for emotion detection. Build up a real-time image processing and facial recognition model based on the computer vision algorithm. Train the open source dataset and set up classifier to identify emotions (Happy, Sad, Angry and Natural). 

Audio Recognition combined with Natural Language Processing for emotion deduction. Based on Baidu API platform, collected audio data can be translated into textual content, evaluated and execute emotion detection task

IoT application. Input emotion data into local file and export a CSV file. If there is any negative emotion appeared in the file, our system will automatically inform family members by SMS and control smart devices to provide a more suitable environment for elderly home. For example, the system will play soft music and adjust the home lighting when it detects elderly's passive moods.

Final thoughts & next steps
Improve and perfect our system to increase recognition accuracy. Using Cloud Computing and BigData Storage to build smart communityiesa nd smart cityies.We also expect to learn and join Xiaomi XiaoAI developer platform and Xiaomi IoT developer platform with a view to reaching more beneficiaries.
